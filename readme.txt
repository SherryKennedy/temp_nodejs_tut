tutorial

// using HTTP module
// intro and details later
// some point all of code will involve server side code
// syntax in more detail later

with http module
see visual representation of  use of node
rather than slides

http module will allow us to setup a web server
large part of the course is to setup own server and the api
use an extraction with http module by the name of EXPRESS

basics 
buid a slider for example
can do on own or copy paste code from someone online
both ok
someone struggled and left it for you 
when install node , auto installs npm

npm: node package manager

enables to do 3 things:
reuse our own code
in other projects
reuse with others
reuse from others

npmjs.com

can find everything from utility functions to full frameworks
ie do a search for the bootstrap on the site
this will bring you to the docs and weekly downloads

typical npm package , can have many
folder with js code
modules and dependancies
all 3 used interchangeably
package, module , dependencies
anyone can publish anything
some will be useless
good indication, if weekly download is good,
battle tested and good to go. 

if there is a bug,
someone fixed,
could be in pkg or solution for it. 

npmjs.com 

search for npm bootstrap
npm --version
6.9.0
node --version
v12.4.0

if install globally on a mac
it will most likely ask for the serial
the credential for it.
